##    BEAST:  A Bayesian Ensemble Algorithm for Change-Point Detection and Time Series Decomposition

**BEAST (Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality, and Trend) is a fast, generic Bayesian model averaging algorithm to decompose time series or 1D sequential data into individual components, such as abrupt changes, trends, and periodic/seasonal variations, as described in <ins>[Zhao et al. (2019)](https://go.osu.edu/beast2019)</ins>. BEAST is useful for *changepoint detection (e.g., breakpoints, structural breaks,joinpoints, regime shifts, or anomalies), trend analysis, time series decomposition (e.g., trend vs seasonality), time series segmentation, and interrupted time series analysis*. See a list of <a href="#publicationid"> selected studies using BEAST </a>.**


**Quick Installation**
> BEAST was impemented in C/C++ but accessible from  R, Python, Matlab, and Octave.  Install it as follows:

* [Python](#python):   **`pip install Rbeast`**   
* [Matlab](#matlab):  **`eval(webread('http://b.link/rbeast',weboptions('cert','')))`**
* [Octave](#octave):  **`eval(webread('http://b.link/rbeast'))`**  
* [R lang](#r):  **`install.packages("Rbeast")`** 


   
**Quick Usage**

> One-liner code for Python, Matlab and R:
```
# Python example
import Rbeast as rb; (Nile, Year)=rb.load_example('nile'); o=rb.beast(Nile,season='none'); rb.plot(o)

# Matlab/Octave example
load('Nile'); o = beast(Nile, 'season','none'); plotbeast(o)

# R example
library(Rbeast); data(Nile); o = beast(Nile); plot(o)
```

An R package **`Rbeast`** has been deposited at [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rbeast). ( On CRAN, there is another Bayesian time-series package named "beast", which has nothing to do with the BEAST algorithim. Our package is `Rbeast`. Also, `Rbeast` has nothing to do with the famous "Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees" aglorithm.) Install  `Rbeast` in R using

```R
install.packages("Rbeast")
 ```
 



#### Run and test Rbeast in R
   
The main functions in Rbeast are `beast(Y, ...)`, `beast.irreg(Y, ...)`, and `beast123(Y, metadata, prior, mcmc, extra)`. The code snippet below  provides a starting point for the basic usage.  

 ```R
library(Rbeast)
data(Nile)                       #  annual streamflow of the Nile River    
out = beast(Nile, season='none') #  'none': trend-only data without seasonlaity   
print(out)                   
plot(out)
?Rbeast                          # See more details about the usage of `beast`    
      
tetris()                         # if you dare to waste a few moments of your life 
minesweeper()                    # if you dare to waste a few more moments of your life

## Installation for Matlab  <a name=matlab>    </a>

[![View Rbeast on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72515-rbeast)
 

Install the Matlab version of **BEAST** automatically to a local folder of your choice by running 
  ```Matlab  
  beastPath = 'C:\beast\'                   
  eval( webread('http://b.link/rbeast') )  
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Note on Automatic Installtion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
  % 1. Write permission needed for your chosen path; the variable name must be 'beastPath'.   %
  % 2. If webread has a certificate error, run the following line instead:                    %
      eval(  webread( 'http://b.link/rbeast', weboptions('cert','') )  )                       %
  % 3. If the automatic installation fails, please manually download all the files (see blow) %       
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  ```
> The above will download all the files in the [Rbeast\Matlab folder at Github](https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast) to the chosen folder: if `beastPath` is missing, a default temporary folder (e.g., `C:\Users\$user_name$\AppData\Local\Temp\Rbeast for Windows 10`) will be used. If the automatic script fails, please download the Matlab files from [Github](https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast) manually. These files include a Matlab mex library compiled from the C soure code (e.g., `Rbeast.mexw64` for Windows, `Rbeast.mexa64` for Linux, `Rbeast.mexmaci64` for MacOS) and some Matlab wrapper functions (e.g.,`beast.m`, and `beast123.m`) similar to the R interface, as well as some test datasets (e.g., Nile.mat, and co2.mat). 

> We generated the Matlab mex binary library on our own machines with Win10, Ubuntu 22.04, and macOS High Sierra. If they fail on your machine, the mex library can be compiled  from the C source code files under `Rbeast\Source`. If needed, we are happy to work with you to compile for your specific OS or machines. Additional information on compilations from the C source is also given below.

#### Run and test Rbeast in Matlab
The Matlab API is similar to those of R. Below is a quick example:
  ```Matlab
   help beast
   help beast123  
   load('Nile.mat')                                   % annual streamflow of the Nile River startin from year 1871
   out = beast(Nile, 'season', 'none','start', 1871)  % trend-only data without seasonality
   printbeast(out)
   plotbeast(out)
  ```
## Installation for Octave <a name=octave>    </a>

The same as for Matlab. Now, only Windows platforms are supported. If needed for other platforms (e.g., Octave in Linux and Mac), please contact the author at zhao.1423@osu.edu for support.

----
##  Installation for Python  <a name=python>   </a>


<p  align="left">   
 <a href= "https://pypi.org/project/Rbeast/"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=plastic&logo=python&label=Python%20%20&message=pip install Rbeast&color=brightgreen" height="20"></a>
</p> 

A package **`Rbeast`** has been deposited at PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/Rbeast/. Run the command below in a console to install:
  
  ```python
    pip install Rbeast
  ```
> Binary wheel files were built on Windows, MacOS, and Linux for Python version 3.7 to 3.11 (either x86_64 or arm64 CPU). If the installation fails, please install from the source to build the package using `pip install Rbeast --no-binary :none:`, which requies a C/C++ compliler (e.g., requiring gcc on Linux or xcode on Mac). If needed, contact Kaiguang Zhao (zhao.1423@osu.edu) to help build the package for your OS platform and Python version.

#### Run and test Rbeast in Python

 
 
`Nile` is annual streamflow of the River Nile, starting from Year 1871. As annual observations, it has no periodic component (i.e., `season='none'`).

  ```python
import Rbeast as rb                                       # Import the Rbeast package as `rb`
nile, year = rb.load_example('nile')                      # a sample time series
o          = rb.beast( nile, start=1871, season='none')
rb.plot(o)
rb.print(o)
o  # see a list of output fields in the output variable o
```

The second example `googletrend` is a monthly time series of the Google Search popularity of the word ***beach*** over the US. This monthly time series is reguarly-spaced (i.e., deltat=`1 month` =`1/12 year`); it has a cyclyic component with a period of 1 year. That is, the number of data points per period is `period` / `deltat` = 1 year / 1 month = 1/(1/12) = 12.

  ```python
beach, year = rb.load_example('googletrend')
o = rb.beast(beach, start= 2004.0, deltat=1/12, period = 1.0)       # the time unit is unknown or arbitrary
o = rb.beast(beach, start= 2004.0, deltat=1/12, period ='1.0 year') # the time unit is fractional year
o = rb.beast(beach, start= 2004.0, deltat='1 month', period =1.0)   # the time unit is fractional year
rb.plot(o)
rb.print(o)
  ```

## Installation for Julia/IDL (yet to come)

Wrappers in Julia and IDL are being developed: We welcome contributions and help from interested developers. If interested, contact Kaiguang Zhao at zhao.1423@osu.edu.

## Description of BEAST
Interpretation of time series data is affected by model choices. Different models can give different or even contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms for the same data–a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change,seasonality, and trend (BEAST) of this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition by forgoing the "single-best-model" concept and embracing all competing models into the inference via a Bayesian model averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, finance, public health, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data. Details on BEAST are reported in [Zhao et al. (2019)](https://go.osu.edu/beast2019). The paper is available at https://go.osu.edu/beast2019.

## Note on computation

As a Bayesian algorithm, BEAST is fast and is possibly among the fastest implementations of Bayesian time-series analysis algorithms of the same nature. (But it is still slower, compared to nonBayesian methods.) For applications dealing with a few to thousands of time series, the computation won't be an practical concern. But for remote sensing/geospatial applications that may easily involve millions or billions of time series, computation will be a big challenge for Desktop computer users. We suggest first testing BEAST on a single time series or small image chips first to determine whether BEAST is appropriate for your applications and, if yes, estimate how long it may take to process the whole image. 

In any case, for those users handling stacked time-series images, do not use `beast` or `beast.irreg`. Use **`beast123`** instead, which can handle 3D data cubes and allow parallel computing.  We also welcome consultation with Kaiguang Zhao (zhao.1423@osu.edu) to give specific suggestions if you see some value of BEAST for your applications.
